# ✏️ Courses  

### 🖥️ POIR612 - Text as Data for Social Scientists  
📍 _University of Southern California_, Fall 2025  

<details><summary>📖 Expand summary »</summary><p>The course introduces social scientists to computational techniques for analyzing large-scale textual information. In an era where vast amounts of text—from policy speeches and legislative documents to social media and news archives—shape our understanding of the world, this course equips students with the methodological tools to extract meaningful insights from unstructured data. Bridging natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and the social sciences, the course focuses on practical applications in areas like political discourse analysis, sentiment detection, and policy communication. Students will learn essential preprocessing techniques (e.g., tokenization, stemming, stopword removal), text representation methods (bag-of-words, word embeddings), and advanced modeling approaches, including supervised learning, topic modeling, and deep learning techniques such as BERT and large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI and LLAMA. By integrating hands-on coding exercises with theoretical discussions, the course prepares students to engage with textual data critically, ensuring they can apply these techniques to real-world social science research while considering the ethical and methodological challenges of working with text-based data.</p>

### 📢 Mobilization and Political Economy, Quantitative Methods Course  
📍 _NSF-REU Summer Research Program_, Summer 2023  

<details><summary>🌐 <a href="https://www.migapprogram.com/">MPE website</a></summary><p> </p>
</details>  
<details><summary>📖 Program summary »</summary><p>The MPE Summer Program is an eight-week, in-residence research and mentoring initiative funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) award (Award No. #2150250). Designed to support underrepresented and first-generation undergraduate students, the program prioritizes recruiting from Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). It enhances academic success through rigorous methodological training and structured guidance for graduate school applications. With an interdisciplinary approach, MPE equips students with the analytical tools to examine key issues in mobilization and political economy. By integrating theory with hands-on data analysis, participants develop essential research skills to tackle pressing social, political, and policy challenges, bridging the gap between academia and real-world applications.</p>
</details>  
<details><summary>📖 Course summary »</summary><p>The Quantitative Methods Course lays a strong foundation in research design, descriptive statistics, and regression analysis before advancing to complex techniques like hypothesis testing and multi-level modeling (MLM). These methods are particularly powerful in examining structural inequalities, allowing students to analyze the interplay between individual behaviors and systemic factors. A key component of the course is hands-on training in R programming, enabling participants to work with real-world datasets, such as the Collaborative Multi-racial Post-election Survey (CMPS) and census data. The program provides students with essential analytical skills for academia, government, and private industry by combining methodological rigor with a focus on diversity and inclusion. Students gain valuable experience in data management, statistical modeling, and policy analysis—preparing them for a world increasingly driven by data science.</p>
