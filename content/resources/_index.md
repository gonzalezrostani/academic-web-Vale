# Research & Tools  

Welcome! This page contains research tools, notes, and side projects I’ve put together over time. Most of them are beginner-friendly, but I aim to provide useful starting points for anyone interested in these topics. I'll keep updating this space as I systematize more of my work. I hope you find it helpful!
