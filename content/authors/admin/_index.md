I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [Department of Politics at Princeton University](https://politics.princeton.edu/), affiliated with the Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice. In Fall 2025, I will join the [University of Southern California](https://dornsife.usc.edu/poir/)'s (USC) POIR Department as an Assistant Professor. My research lies at the intersection of international political economy and comparative politics. My work explores the impact of technological change on individual political behavior and the evolution of party systems. I use mixed-methods approaches, combining quantitative analysis, text as data, survey experiments, and formal modeling to study the interplay between economic, cultural, and institutional factors. My interests also include international trade, inequality, and political methodology.

My work on these and related topics has been published or conditionally accepted in journals including the *Journal of Politics*, *Economics & Politics*, and *Legislative Studies Quarterly*. You can explore my ongoing research projects below and some resources I've developed [here](https://gonzalez-rostani.netlify.app/resources/). Teaching experience and materials are available [here](https://gonzalez-rostani.netlify.app/courses/).

I received my PhD in Political Science from the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.polisci.pitt.edu/) in 2024. Before moving to the U.S., I earned an MA in Public Policy from the [Universidad Católica del Uruguay](https://ucu.edu.uy/es/taxonomy/term/40/node/113) and a BA in Public Accounting from [Universidad de la República](https://udelar.edu.uy/portal/). I have also taught at Universidad de la República, worked at KPMG, served as a political organizer, and advised national politicians in Uruguay.
