  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>
    I study how technological change—especially automation and artificial intelligence—reshapes political attitudes, parties, and democratic institutions across advanced economies and the Global South, using causal inference and computational text analysis (NLP and large language models).

<strong>Position.</strong>
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at the 
<a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/poir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Southern California</a>. 
Before joining USC, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at 
<a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princeton University</a>.
</div>

<div class="about-section">
<strong>Research.</strong>
My research examines how technological change—especially automation and artificial intelligence—reshapes politics and society. 
I study how these shifts affect political attitudes and the rise of populist movements, with work spanning advanced economies and the Global South. 
I also work on international trade, inequality, and political methodology, and develop machine-learning tools to measure political discourse and populist rhetoric.
</div>

<div class="about-section">
<strong>Publications & service.</strong> My work has been published or is forthcoming in journals including the <i>Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Economics & Politics</i>, <i>Legislative Studies Quarterly</i>, and 
<i>PS: Political Science & Politics</i>. 
I am a member of the <i>2025 APSA Task Force on AI and Political Science</i>, where I serve on the committee on economic inequality and the labor force.
</div>

<div class="about-section">
<strong>Public engagement & mentoring.</strong>
I care deeply about making scientific knowledge accessible. 
I am affiliated with the 
<a href="https://mpeprogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobilization & Political Economy NSF-REU program</a>, 
which supports the research paths of underrepresented students. 
I also co-direct 
<a href="https://www.razonesypersonas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Razones y Personas</i></a>, a 14-year-old blog where more than 50 social scientists publish weekly pieces on politics and policy, with a focus on Latin America and Uruguay.
</div>

<div class="about-section">
<strong>Background.</strong>
Before moving to the United States, I worked in Uruguayan politics as a grassroots organizer and advised a member of Congress. 
Earlier, I worked at KPMG—an experience that broadened my perspective on industry and continues to complement my academic work.
