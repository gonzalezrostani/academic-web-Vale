### Working papers 

**"_Legislators’ Religiosity and Same-Sex Marriage in Latin America_" 2021 with [Scott Morgenstern](https://smorgens.wixsite.com/website) _(Revise &
Resubmit at Latin American Research Review - LARR)_**

The issue of same-sex marriage has risen to the top of political agendas across Latin America, and it has thus drawn much attention from students of public opinion.  However, we still know very little about how legislators—those who make the policies—feel about LGBTQ+ same-sex marriage.  In response, we utilize a survey of the region’s legislators to first examine the range in support among countries and show how it correlates with legal changes.  We then examine the correlates of support of legislators themselves.  While gender, age, and ideology play minor roles, our multivariate models confirm that religiosity drives support in two ways: not only does it affect legislators’ individual level of support in the expected direction, it also works as a contextual variable such that having even a few more secular colleagues encourages pious legislators to support same sex marriage, and vice versa.

### Work in progress 

**"_Engaged Robots, and Disengaged Workers: Automation and Political Apathy_" 2021. (to be presented at MPSA 2022)**
This paper theorizes the mechanism by which, after the wave of automation, vulnerable voters feel detached from political parties.  I name this effect _automation disengagement_.  I argue that we need to understand how automation anxiety thanks to the exposition of risks reflects into individual political preferences.  In particular, I argue that the underlying mechanism is a decline of political engagement, and that is what makes losers of automation more prone to support anti-establishment rhetoric, or what explains the decline in voter turnout.  To test my theoretical framework I focus on 20 European countries and use survey data --European Social Survey (ESS). I provide empirical evidence linking technological change and political disengagement using a Bayesian hierarchical model.  I  find that voters more exposed to technological risks are losing their engagement with political parties.  My findings have important implications for understanding the changes in developed countries' party politics.

**"_Political-Economic Polarization. From Economic Polarization to Partisan Polarization_" 2021. (presented at MPSA 2021 and Workshop at Universidad Católica de Uruguay)** 

 While there is little doubt that technological change is generating labor market polarization (LMP), we know very little about how economic polarization translates into political polarization and how these effects are moderated by the institutional environment. I argue that LMP translates into political polarization and that outsider (extreme) party leaders have a strategic advantage in electoral competition under these circumstances. Against the commonly held view that parties under majoritarianism are moderated by the median voter, I argue that winner-take-all systems can be prone to policy extremism. In contexts where candidates and parties must build coalitions to govern, policy positions are moderated but non-policy issues such as values are more extreme. I build a theoretical model for better understanding the political economy of polarization by extending a model of electoral competition between a mainstream and populist party leader. Then I evaluate its empirical implications using party manifesto data, and the cases of the US and Germany. The findings shed light on the relationship between polarization and electoral and party institutions. Polarization  over  redistribution  policies  is  smaller  in  countries  with PR electoral systems than in countries with majoritarian two-party systems. Moreover, routine voters are more likely to switch from the establishment to populist party leaders in a context of increasing job polarization.


**"_Unevenly Distribution of Minimum Wage Effects Across Firms: 	Does Firms' Size Matters?_" 2021. (presented at LASA 2021)**

Between 2004 and 2006, the Uruguayan government implemented significant changes in labor market policy by raising minimum wages and installing coordinated wage bargaining for all firms. Together, these two policies implied a shock in firms' labor regulations. However, small firms were more exposed to the rise of minimum wage than their large counterparts. I exploit this fact to evaluate the impacts of minimum wages on hiring conditions, such as the evolution of wages and social security contributions (SSC) and the distribution of skilled workers. Adopting a fuzzy differences-in-differences approach, I demonstrate that the effects of the minimum wage hike were unevenly distributed across firms. After the policy, social security contributions increased more in small firms, and wages increased more in large ones. Moreover, the distribution of skills across firms shows a composition effect by which small firms lost skilled employees relative to large ones. Overall, the policy increased the cost of labor in small firms more than in large firms. The policy also seems to affect workers' sorting by helping more productive workers move toward larger firms. The findings have important implications for understanding wage bargaining politics.
